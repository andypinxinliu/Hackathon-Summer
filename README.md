# Hackathon-Summer-2021
This project currently implements DNN to do the regression of gene expression that can predict human age. We will also implements svm, random forest, and xgboost and see which will have a better performance

We have done our initial datatrainning through DNN, and the result is shown in the prediction.csv. The trainning code is in the colab notebook Hackathon-AgePrediction.ipynb
